!DISCLAIMER! 
1. Linux is currently unsupported, because of many GMS issues with Wine. However, I heard that the mod works fine with Proton, so try it at your own risk. 
2. Synchronization between players actions in the mod is done fairly simple. There is no battle sync, or stuff like that. There are many reasons why I can't expand on this, briefly they concern coding issues and how time consuming synchronization is. Online is very different than local multiplayer, and making for example the same battle sync means rewriting the good portion of the game. Thanks for understanding. 
3. No, it's not gonna work on demo version of the game. Though I might make it work soon enough, so stay put.

If you've got any questions, feel free to join my mod's discord server and ask. Also report any bugs you encountered while playing my wacky mod. 

If you want to play with a mod that adds multiplayer that can be played on the same device(local multiplayer), and that has many gameplay changes(like shared battles) focused on the multiplayer itself I'd recommend this mod.

This is a port of my online multiplayer mod I made for Undertale Yellow. Since I started porting it I've added useful new features and optimized the netcode. Don't expect anything ground breaking, it's a fairly simple mod, but I think it gets the job done just fine.
Because of how DELTARUNE manages its chapter system, I couldn't release the mod so that it would work for every chapter at once. So wait until I port it and adapt it specifically for other chapters.

If you want to play with your friends only you'll have to use either local network or Hamachi/Radmin. And yeah, to join a server one of the players must host it. Moreover, if you're hosting a local server, the IP address should be 127.0.0.1, or whatever hosts hamachi/radmin ip is. 

To actually host/join a server, you need to press "O" on your keyboard. 
This will open a menu where you can change your nickname, IP, port, change the maximum number of players, skin for your character, etc. I wouldn't recommend touching port in any way, leave it as it is.
