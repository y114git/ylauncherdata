### Version 2.3.0 — 16.11.25

- **Full Support for All Resource Types**

  - When merging mods, in addition to code and textures, fonts, rooms, shaders, sounds, and tilesets are now also merged.

- **Merge Conflict Warnings**

  - When merging multiple mods, if conflicts are detected between them (when different mods modify the same resources), a special dialog will now be shown with information about the conflicts. You'll be able to see which mods conflict with each other, and optionally open detailed logs for a more detailed study of the problem.

- **Fixes and Improvements**

  - Fixed an issue with pagination on the mod search page; page navigation now works correctly.
  - Improved cleanup of temporary files after mod merging, which should slightly speed up the launcher and free up more disk space.

### Version 2.2.0 — 11.11.25

- **Complete Library Rework + Multi-Mod System**

  - The library no longer has slots, now you simply click on a mod and use it. Thanks to the multi-mod system, you can select multiple mods at once. This works through step-by-step merging of mod files, but be warned: some mods may override each other. To avoid this, when selecting 2+ mods, you can configure priority for mods. Those with higher priority will be merged last, meaning if several mods affect the same point, the final change will come from the mod with the highest priority.
  - Also, to avoid waiting a long time for mod merging, I recommend creating a modpack after selecting your mods. When launching a modpack, the game will start instantly with the selected mods and priority set during modpack creation. You can now also import (even via URL) or export mods (in both DELTAHUB and DELTAMOD formats).

- **Search Page Rework + GameBanana Mod Support**

  - Now on the mod search page, you can also install mods directly from GameBanana (and from other sources in the future). While you'll see all mods, if a mod wasn't created for the DELTAHUB format or at least DELTAMOD format, it won't be possible to install it automatically (though you can still view all the necessary information about it). You'll need to contact the author and ask them to add DELTAHUB support.
  - You can now also choose the number of mods per page. The more you specify, the wider the search will be, but the load will also be higher.

- **Undertale Yellow Support**

  - Rejoice, Yellow fans! You can now launch Undertale Yellow in DELTAHUB, download mods for it, and if you haven't installed it before, you can use the full installation function to download it immediately (just like for DELTARUNEdemo). After installation, all paths will be automatically set, and you'll only need to launch the game.

- **Plugin System + Migration of Save Manager, Mod Editor, and XDELTA Patcher to Plugin Format**

  - For those who wanted to extend DELTAHUB's functionality, a convenient plugin system has been added, along with a Plugins page where you can configure plugins, enable/disable them, download and import them (even via URL). All details about this system are here: <https://github.com/y114git/DELTAHUB/wiki/Plugins-Guide.md>.
  - Also, the built-in functions of Mod Management, XDELTA Patcher, and Save Manager are now separate plugins. The migration was made because not everyone needed these functions, and for some they were just clutter on the screen. Now you can choose and download what you need yourself.

- **Built-in Chat**

  - Instead of the button to go to the save manager at the bottom right, there's now a Chat button. The chat is completely anonymous, and you can switch between 5 different channels for your languages. In the future, this function might also become a plugin, and instead there will be a button that you can configure to do anything (for example, the same Chat, some tab, game launch, or a plugin).

- **PortProton Support**

  - Now, if you're using Linux, you can enable an option to use PortProton instead of Wine.

- **Spanish Language Support**

  - Spanish language has been added to DELTAHUB! A huge thank you to the Spanish community for their support.

- **Bug Fixes, Optimization, and Other Minor Changes**

  - In settings, you can now open the DELTAHUB folder with a single button, where mods, settings, plugins, and localization files are stored.
  - Everything that could be optimized has been maximally optimized, caching and asynchrony have been added everywhere possible. Using the program should now be much easier and more pleasant.
  - This update can rightfully be called the biggest bug-fixing update. You may never know this, but during the development of this update, more than 47 bugs were fixed, from minor to truly major ones (for which a separate patch could have been released). Huge work was done, and I hope my efforts won't disappoint you!

### Version 2.1.2/3 — 13.10.25

- **Library Filters!**

  - Now you can filter mods not only on the main page but also in the library! In addition to the main tags, you can now also sort mods based on whether they are local or not.

- **Save Collection Selection and Management**

  - If you've created at least one save collection, you can now choose exactly which collection to play with when launching the game. After you finish playing, all your saved actions will be automatically saved back into the collection you selected.

- **Linux Launch Fix**

  - Now, if you are launching the game without Steam, the launcher will immediately attempt to start it using Wine. Please make sure you have it installed.

### Version 2.1.1 — 03.10.25

- **GameBanana URL > External URL**
  - The "GameBanana URL" field has been replaced by "External URL," allowing links to any site (itch.io, ModDB, etc.). For better security, a new validation check blocks direct download links. The banana icon 🍌 has also been removed.

- **Versioning for Lang files**
  - Language files now can have a version number. If you manually edit one of default lang files, you must also increase its version inside the file. Otherwise, the launcher will restore the original file to prevent issues. This does not affect custom/fan-made language files.

### Version 2.1.0 — 03.09.25

- **Complete Localization System Remake + Chinese Language Support**
  - Previously, you could only use the languages built into the launcher, and you had to restart the launcher to switch, plus there were a lot of bugs. However, the era of localization has now arrived! From now on, languages are stored in the `lang` folder, next to the `settings` and `mods` folders. In addition to the official languages (A huge thank you to the Chinese community for their support), you can now add your own fan translations or even make FUNNY translations (WHAT?!). What's more, you can now choose the font for the launcher yourself by simply editing the lang file. In the `font` field, specify the name of the font file, which must be in the same folder as the language file! All other details are [HERE](https://github.com/y114git/DELTAHUB/wiki/Localization-and-Lang-system-Guide).

- **Deltamod Compatibility + .LZMA and .TAR.GZ Support**
  - In addition to supporting two new archive formats, you can now literally drop a mod created for the Deltamod format into the `mods` folder (regardless of whether it's an archive or a folder) and DELTAHUB will automatically convert it to the local mod format for DH! Downloading via links (`deltahub://`) is also fully supported, so mod developers won't have to worry either. More details [HERE](https://github.com/y114git/DELTAHUB/wiki/Deltamod-compatibility).

- **Theme Manager**
  - You can now **import and export** your launcher's appearance settings! A new button has appeared in the customization settings that allows you to save your colors, background image, music, and sounds into a single `.dhtheme` file and share it with friends.

- **Beta Updates**
  - An option has been added to the settings to receive **experimental beta versions** of the launcher. Turn it on if you want to be the first to try new features!

- **Full Screen Mode**
  - For full immersion, a checkbox has been added to the settings to launch the application in **full screen mode**.

- **_icon for Local Mods**
  - The issue with icon display for local mods has been fixed. Also, for a local mod to have an icon, an `_icon` file (`.png`, `.jpg`, etc.) must be in the mod's folder, next to `config.json`.

- **Against Piracy!**
  - Now, when you try to disable Xdelta mode when creating or editing a mod, or when installing a mod that uses file replacement, you will receive a warning. You can only continue to use or create such a mod if you agree to the terms and take full responsibility.

- **Offline Interface**
  - Now you can create local mods even without an internet connection (this should have been the case before, but there was a small bug).

- The code has been greatly cleaned up, and the launcher's performance has been slightly accelerated (if anyone cares).

### Version 2.0.0 Alpha — 16.08.25

- **YLauncher is now DELTAHUB!** This is more than just a name change — the launcher has been rebranded and is now a full-fledged platform for not only translations, but for any mods. You now have a huge library with a convenient search function at your disposal.

- **A completely new interface!** The launcher has received a fully redesigned look that is more modern and convenient. Finally!
  - **Updated startup screen:** Now, when you launch the launcher, you are greeted not by just an icon, but by an animated splash screen. You can turn it off in the settings.
  - **Built-in mod library:** All your installed mods are now in one place, where you can configure anything you want, such as whether to launch a mod immediately without any extra settings, or to set up mods for each chapter separately. Also, the DEMO VERSION checkbox has been moved from the settings to the library.

- **Complete mod management**
  - Now you can create your own mods and publish them. You can update them yourself, customize them, and have full control over them.
  - Now, if you need to update a file, you can update just one of the mod's components, and users will no longer need to reinstall the entire mod from scratch, as was the case before. It will be enough to simply update only the changed components.
  - You can also add your own local mods and now, you can even edit them!

- **Full launcher customization and other changes:**
  - You can now customize the launcher to suit your preferences — ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING! The background music, the splash screen sound, the background, the color of backgrounds, the color of text and other elements, and so on!
  - The launcher now runs even faster. The basic initialization has been sped up many times over, and you can make the launcher start even faster by disabling the splash screen in the settings.
  - The button to update the interface and mod information is now located to the right of the Settings button.
  - The Erase button is gone; in its place, the save manager has been moved from the settings.
  - Now, when you launch the game with a mod, the files are no longer mindlessly copied into the game folder. Instead, the original files are moved to a temporary folder while the game is running, and when the game ends, the mod files are deleted from the game folder, and the original files are returned to their place.
  - Many other minor changes, which I advise you to check out for yourself :)

- Now, when exporting save slots, if they were completed, not only the main file is exported, but also the completion file associated with it.

* New feature: Save Manager! Now you can manage your saves directly in the launcher.

- How to open: Go to "Settings" and click the new "Saves✨" button.

- Collections: Create separate "collections" of saves for each chapter. This is ideal for storing saves from different playthroughs (for example, "pacifist" and "genocide") and not getting confused.

- Backup: Easily copy saves from the main slots to any collection and back. You can copy one selected slot or all three at once.

- Direct editing: For advanced users! Just double-click on an occupied slot to open a simple editor and manually change the values in the save file. Soon there will be a much more convenient and understandable editor!

### Version 1.5.1 - 30.06.25

- For those who received an error about a lack of access rights to the game folder, the launcher now tries to fix this automatically, and if it fails, it displays a message asking you to run as an administrator or manually change the folder rights.

### Version 1.5.0 - 28.06.25

- **2 New features: Direct launch and Your own translation!** By enabling direct launch, when you launch the game through the launcher, selecting the desired chapter (Chapter tab), the game will start immediately from that chapter, without the need to first select the chapter separately in the main menu of the game. Due to technical problems, it only works on Windows/Linux, and is also not compatible with launching through Steam.
- **The second feature is Your own translation**, now you can add your own translation/mod/changes for each chapter separately, your added translation is saved in the list and you can select several custom translations and switch between them, if you are too lazy to add a translation for each chapter, you can take an archive that contains everything you need, and also in the folders with chapters, and just add the translation specifically through the Main menu of the game tab (Since everything there works on the root folder). You can give any name to your translation separately, and the most interesting thing is that you can add your own translation directly from a URL without the need to download anything separately.
- Now the No Changes option is grayer, local translations (Which you added) are always yellow and at the top of the list, and the main translations are white if they have not yet been downloaded, green if they have been downloaded and do not need to be updated, and orange if they have been downloaded but need to be updated.
- A little more compatibility with MacOS has been added, and problems with a lack of rights for some users have been fixed.

### Version 1.4.0/1.4.1 - 23.06.25

- **New feature: Shortcuts! (Hey!)** Now you can create a shortcut to launch with your settings. Just set everything up as you like, click "Shortcut", and the launcher will create a special launch file. When you click on it, the game will start with the selected translations and settings, and the launcher itself will not even appear on the screen.
- The "Update" button has been replaced with "Shortcut". The list of translations is now updated automatically on launch. However, you can now perform a Check for Updates, right from the settings menu.
- The launcher's core has been changed, which made it much more stable and pleasant.
- Now by default the launcher has a new beautiful Deltarune theme, but in the settings you can still choose the Legacy Theme, which will return the old, good look of the launcher up to 1.4.0
- "Change log" has been added.
- A check and a warning have been added when selecting a chapter folder instead of a game folder.
